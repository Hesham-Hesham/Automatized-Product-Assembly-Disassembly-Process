#  Automatized Product Assembly/Disassembly Process
Product assembly/disassembly using industrial sensors and electric/pneumatic actuators

## Implementation


 - The simulation was made on simulink using [contact planes ](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47417-simscape-multibody-contact-forces-library) of the multibody library to simulate the physics intended in the design.
 - [Internal force](https://www.mathworks.com/help/sm/ref/internalforce.html;jsessionid=9e8ee696c049873b9be9c99ea95d) was used to simulate the suction process


<br />



## Software Used
- MATLAB simulink multibody library
- Autodesk multibody add-on
- Arduino IDE
